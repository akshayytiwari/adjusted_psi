**Accurate estimation of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections from population-based surveys**  
  In this project,  we developed a rigorous mathematical formalism that accounts for symptom overlap as well as test sensitivity and specificity and yields accurate estimates of the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We applied it to data from 50 published serosurveys, spanning 29 nations and collectively sampling ~0.8 million individuals.
